A Led light has a very long life, so if this damaged, you can repair this using simple tools.

Hi guys, I am working in my lab room, and suddenly with a small explosion, my room light turned off. This one is 5 watts Orient company LED light. This one has been working well for two years. So, today we will learn about the internal circuity and repair this LED. Because Led’s has excellent power to withstand over the years, we will troubleshoot the small internal Led’s first and then the main circuitry. Also, I will tell you some common problems, which can be repairable if you are a techie, which may save you a little money.

troubleshooting methods:
Check the voltage value across the end of the driver stage. If this is more than 30 volts, then okay otherwise, we have to repair this. 
then:
check the Led’s one by one, keeping the multimeter in continuity mode. If all are turning on, then okay otherwise, we have to change any specific or all of them. 
then:
If only one Led is not working, then we have to remove this Led; either we can place a similar new one or a resistor of 0.5 watts 270 ohms.
then:
If the circuit is burned or damaged highly, we can replace the whole circuitry and led PCB with a MOB PCB that supports the onboard power supply, rectifier, current controlling IC, and LEDs. Commonly available in Market. 
then:
If you don’t want to do or do not know about AC power, go to a nearby market and buy a new one. 

more common problems:
Keep in mind all the small Led’s on Pcb are joined in series. If any one of them is damaged or blown up, the whole system stops working. In 75% of cases, this is the only problem that can be solved by placing the same value resistor or replacing the led with a new one.
The resistor of the driver stage is high wattage cement coated, in 170ohms. In 10% of cases, the resistor is faulty. This resistor saves the led from high voltage (it blew up if high voltage is given). Find the same new resistor and replace this. 
In 15% cases, there may be a fault in MOV (metal oxide varistor) or electrolytic capacitor. If found faulty, you can first check them, then replace them with a new one of the same value.

JLCPCB:
JLCPCB is the one of the most popular PCB makers. Price is just $2 for 2, 4 and 6 layer PCB. They just launched new purple solder mask, aluminum Pcb and 3d printing service in very low cost. Pcb quality is not compromised at any cost. Check them out right now from Here.
JLCPCB Is also providing new user coupons and sign-up rewards of up to $30. So, check them out from here. Register using this link to get Free PCB assembly service coupons. Get your 2 layer to 6-layer PCB’s just in $2, stencil and PCB assembly service in just $7.
